queensland gamejam

Main aim - Use what I have to create the skeleton for a game (if I want to make something out of what I have, use what I have in order to make a skeleton for it)


Game ideas

- The game will be a 2d pixel art game that has different types of levels

- I only have access to the brackeys game jam videos, therefore I should base it upon that
- platformer


simple game using the brackeys video? could make something more personal.

could attempt to make a game that could fit into the idea of the "simone's bakery" game.

if
assets are too hard to make - use the brackeys ones as placeholders


ADD AN INVENTORY SYSTEM
simple one
when I press tab, it opens, has the name of the object in an array, the array will be a length of max 8x8


autoloads:
-global scenes we want to persist throughout entire game


Layers
1 - background
2 - player
3 - enemies
4 - tiles
